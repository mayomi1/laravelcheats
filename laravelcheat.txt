to create model as well as migration do 'php artisan make:model <Model_name_in_Cap> -m'

php artisan make:controller ProductController --resource to make a route that do CRUD

add this to the web route
Route::resource('products','ProductController');

to see the list of all the route
php artisan route:list

Whoops, looks like something went wrong.:=>
check if the .env file is there if not add it by copying the content of .env.example 

To generate laravel key
php artisan key:generate
